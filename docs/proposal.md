## Summary of the Project 
The goal of our project is to segment and label different structures and items in minecraft as our player walks through an environment. An example of a structure that would be classified would be a tree or a sky with clouds. Every important detail in the playerâ€™s view should be labeled correctly and efficiently. If time permits, I will attempt to include minecraft battle royal using reinforcement learning.

Our plan is to generate a world and then scan through the world and label structures and objects.

## AI/ML Algorithms
Using Unet for semantic segmentation, deep Q learning for reinforcement learning.

Start by scanning the entire screen from the top left and returning the block type from each pixel

## Evaluation Plan
The success of the project can be determined in a similar manner to our performance validation where classification and location accuracy success can be evaluated. The project can also include a runtime output that will measure the efficiency. The runtime should decrease as the player walks through the minecraft world as part of a learning algorithm.  

## Appointment with the Instructor
10:00am - 10:15am, Thursday, October 22, 2020

## Goals for Status Reports
Using Malmo functions, figure a way to detect the type and location of a block that appears on the screen.
